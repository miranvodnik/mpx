## Event Driven Task Multiplexing Library

The code contained in the mpx repository contains a library mpx-lib which allows the parallel execution of any number of software tasks in one or more working threads. In addition, the sftp library and the sftp-test program are also located in this repository, to test this library.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/miranvodnik/mpx/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
